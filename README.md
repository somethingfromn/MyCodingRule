# The things you never forget while coding (SLOW, OK?)

### 1st: You are doing ok and doing this for his glory.
### 2nd: It's okay to be slow, but not stop. (Don't forget when you were in the army.).
### 3rd: Let's not get hung up on living with this major, God will let us live somehow.
### 4th: Relax your mind and body with holy sprits.
