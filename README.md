## 3rd: Let's not get hung up on living with this major, God will let us live somehow.

## 1: Mathematical Induction (From BJO)
  ### 1. Sovle the coding problem with human brain step and pensil
  ### 2. Make a plan how to apply that way very efficient in computer's steps, and Consider there's another plan.
  ### 3. Aussme which one is faster than the other, and Select one soultion.
  ### 3. And Do it.
