# The things you never forget while coding (SLOW, OK?)

## 1. You are doing ok and doing this for his glory.
## 2. It's okay to be slow, but not stop. (Don't forget when you were in the army).
## 3. Let's not get hung up on living with this major, God will let us live somehow.
## 4. Relax your mind and body with holy sprits.


# When you try to solve the coding problems

## 1. Mathematical Induction (From BJO)
  ### 1) Sovle the coding problem with human brain step and pensil
  ### 2) Make a plan how to apply that way very efficient in computer's steps, and Consider there's another plan.
  ### 3) Aussme which one is faster than the other, and Select one soultion.
  ### 4) And Do it.
